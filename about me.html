<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I’m Maya, the founder and owner of Crown. I’m a Cloud Engineer, and I live in Portland,
     OR. I also serve in the United States military. Originally from Iran, I’ve lived in Turkey,
     which is why I speak Turkish, in addition to English and Farsi. I moved to the U.S. almost 
     10 years ago.</p>

<p>The idea behind Crown is to help children in need. 
    I had a very challenging childhood, and I know how hard
     it can be to see dreams shattered. This inspired me to create Crown, 
     where 1% of each crown sold goes toward supporting children in need.</p>
    
<p>In addition, I am passionate about helping animals.
     A heartbreaking experience with my own pet, 
     who I couldn’t afford to treat while in the hospital, 
     inspired me to make a promise to myself. I donate 1% of 
     each crown sold to help people who can’t afford the medical care their pets need.</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for supporting Crown, a brand built on love, empathy, and giving back.</p>
